### **Understanding the Patient's Needs**

When a patient travels to your dental clinic from out of town, their experience begins long before they enter your office. Offering assistance with hotel bookings demonstrates a commitment to their overall comfort. Start by:

*   **Providing Recommendations**: Share a list of nearby hotels that offer a range of price points and amenities.

*   **Special Arrangements**: Partner with local hotels to offer discounts or packages specifically for your patients.

*   **Booking Assistance**: If feasible, provide a concierge service to help with the booking process directly.

### **Personal Touches**

*   **Welcome Kits**: Consider preparing a welcome kit for patients that includes maps, local attractions, and information about the hotelâ€™s amenities.

*   **Personalized Communication**: Confirm the hotel booking and provide contact details for any additional questions or concerns.
