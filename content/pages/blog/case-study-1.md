**Orthodontics is the field of dentistry that deals with the direction of the teeth and aims to improve the function and aesthetics of the mouth. German aligners are used to reposition teeth and correct a variety of dental problems, such as gaps between teeth, narrowing of spaces, or spaces that are larger than they should be.**

**Our specialized department provides comprehensive care for patients with orthodontic problems. Every patient is unique and so are their problems. Treatment at the BlueTooth Dental Clinic has several advantages:**

**– Complex treatment. If a patient decides to undergo orthodontic treatment in our clinic, we take photos of his teeth before and after treatment, panoramic and cephalometric graphs, hand graphs to determine the patient's problem. Then in the production of the study models, we analyze and design the treatment plan.**

**For any orthodontic treatment, proper oral hygiene is essential because the application of a fixed or removable appliance creates a rapid deposition of tartar.**

**Each patient will receive advice on dental hygiene and detailed instructions on how to care. The patient is always sure that the best materials are used. This procedure can be a bit difficult at first and the patient may feel a slight pressure or a slight pain sensation in their teeth at the beginning of the treatment.**

**However, after a few days or weeks, these sensations will subside and the patient will begin to feel better. In addition to correcting dental problems, German braces can help improve oral hygiene and prevent other dental problems, such as tooth decay and periodontitis.**
